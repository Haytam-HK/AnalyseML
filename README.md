This project involves downloading a dataset, displaying its statistics through a dashboard, preprocessing the data, and applying various machine learning algorithms. The models' performance will be evaluated and improved by tuning their hyperparameters. Finally, a web or desktop application will be developed using Django or Tkinter to integrate the models, providing users with an interactive interface to view results.
